Bookr
Bookr

DESCRIPTION
Pitch: Bookr is your source for all things Text Book. Picture the AirBNB of text books, a social platform for peer reviewed text books.

MVP: As a user I can log in, and see a list of text books. Each book will have a 5 star rating I can browse from. As a user I can review each book.

Login Page - After a user logs in, they'll be directed to a home page.

Navigation - Navigation is present on all pages, Users should know what page is active by clicking on a nav link and activating their tab.

Home Page - Contains a list of Books laid out in a grid format.

Single Book Page - Loads information about the book, Author, Name, Publisher and a scrolling list of reviews. Add review and delete book buttons present.

Single Book Add Review Page - Clicking add review brings up a form (could be modal, could be its own page) where a user can add their review of the book. Clicking submit adds the review to the books information.

Delete Book - Modal confirming the action, on confirmation user is routed back to the home page and book is gone from the list of books.

Data Modeling: Each book has a Title - String, Author - String, Publisher - String and Reviews- Array of Objects field. The reviews object shape should be Reviewer - String, Review - String.

Stretch Goal: A link to each book will take me to a site where I can purchase a book and compare prices.
